About</h2>
<p>
The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.
While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs. On occasion of the Doctors' Day (March 30, 2020 USA and Australia), the stories of the medical heroes are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.
Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.</p>

		Hiring oppurtunities</h2>
		<p>
			In the midst of doctors, medical staff, policemen etc, who often go unnoticed among the frontline warriors are the employees in the logistics sector. Be it the delivery of oxygen cylinders, medical equipment or medicines, the staff in the logistics sector are currently fighting a battle with time and with the pandemic. Hence the demand for these frontline workers in logistics is witnessing a surge.
			Logistics industry leaders also agreed that hiring has been on an upward trajectory in the sector since it comprises frontline workers whose demand has peaked during the Covid crisis. They said that many roles in the sector have become location agnostic owing to the ongoing pandemic situation leading to the availability of a larger talent pool to tap.

              Hiring has seen momentum in the logistics sector

            Discussing the hiring trends in the logistics sector, Edwin Lobo, Senior General Manager - Human Resources, Mahindra Logistics, said, “Hiring has seen momentum in roles pertaining to warehousing operations, transportation, automation, vendor management and various roles specific to managing e-commerce operations.”
            While agreeing that hiring trends vary across specific seasons in the logistics sector, Rajendra Ghag, CHRO, Blue Dart, said, “However, a hiring trend that is taking over is the ability to assess a candidate’s capability as they work remotely from their homes. Employers would want to hire individuals who would easily be able to adapt to the need of the hour which is digitization and technology, to help boost employee productivity.”

            Lateral versus freshers

Mentioning that there is no generic hiring strategy as it differs across functions, Ghag said, “The focus this year, very much like the last, would be on understanding how a candidate is able to work in the highly volatile environment that the pandemic has created.”

“Our hiring strategy for the last year has put the spotlight on increasing our talent pool to include a diverse set of individuals who will in turn help us tap into a wider customer demographic as well. At Blue Dart, fresher hiring is at 64 per cent and lateral hires pegged at 36 per cent,” Ghag added.

Lobo, Mahindra Logistics, said, “With the second Covid wave in effect, the hiring strategy will revolve around optimising internal talent for existing opportunities and sourcing talent externally if talent to fill the vacant positions are not available within the organisation. MLL has a robust internal job posting mechanism wherein the available opportunities are published and employees get to apply for such positions based on their career aspirations.”

Frontline health workers are the backbone of effective health systems – they are often based in the community and come from the community they serve, they play a critical role in providing a local context for proven health solutions, and they connect families and communities to the health system. Frontline health workers are those directly providing services where they are most needed, especially in remote and rural areas. Many are community health workers and midwives, though they can also include local pharmacists, nurses and doctors who serve in community clinics near people in need. They are the first and often the only link to health care for millions of people, are relatively inexpensive to train and support, and are capable of providing many life-saving interventions. Frontline health workers provide immunizations and treat common infections. They also help families identify conditions which require higher levels of care and provide a link to that referral care. Families rely on these workers as trusted sources of information who have valuable skills in preventing, treating and managing a variety of leading killers including diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. Frontline health workers are also increasingly critical to addressing diseases like diabetes and heart disease that impact the health and productivity of adults around the world. Primarily women, they have become a true force for good, revered in the communities they serve. Simply put, without frontline health workers, there would be no health services for millions of families in low- and middle-income countries. The new Frontline Health Workers Coalition is urging greater and more strategic investment in frontline health workers. The longer we wait, the more lives we will lose, and the opportunities for improved health, higher education levels, economic growth and prosperity will be squandered.

Benefits of being a frontline worker</h2>
<p>
	Insurance scheme for frontline health workers has been extended for another six months, the government said on Friday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review the functioning of different empowered groups through video conference.
The Empowered Group on Economic and Welfare measures made a presentation to the Prime Minister on steps taken such as the extension of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. It was discussed that portability enabled due to the One Nation One Ration Card initiative has helped to benefit more people.
PM Modi directed Central Government should work in close co-ordination with the states to ensure that the poor get the benefits of free food-grain without any issues. He also said that steps should be taken to expedite the settlement of pending insurance claims so that the dependents of the deceased are able to avail of benefits in time.
The Empowered Group on issues relating to facilitating supply chain and logistics management gave a presentation on various advisories relating to measures to be taken to contain the pandemic. PM instructed officials to plan holistically to ensure seamless movement of goods so that supply chain disruptions are avoided.
The Empowered Group on coordinating with the private sector, NGOs and International Organisations briefed the PM on how Government is working in active partnership with the private sector, NGOs and International Organisations.
The PM asked the officials to explore how volunteers from civil society can be utilised to lessen the pressure on the healthcare sector by invoking them in non-specialised tasks. It was discussed that NGOs could help to establish and maintain lines of communication between the patients, their dependents and health care personnel.
Ex-Servicemen could be encouraged to handle call centres for communicating with people under home quarantine.

Safety Measures</h2>
<p>
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[131] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[132][133]

Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[134][135]

The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.[136] It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.[137] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[138][139] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".[140] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[140][141]
